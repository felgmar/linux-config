# Add these parameters to the kernel to workaround
# firmware bugs/quirks least for the following motherboard:
#   - ASUS PRIME H310M-A R2.0 (1)

# Prevent the CPU going deeper than CSTATE 1
# The firmware of the (1) motherboard is buggy
# when it comes to managing CSTATES. This
# parameter prevents the CPU from going any
# deeper than C-STATE 1.
intel_idle.max_cstate=1

# This parameter tells the Linux kernel to ignore
# PCI host bridge information provided by the
# motherboard's (1) ACPI, which is buggy anyways
# and instead let the Linux kernel manage it using
# other ways.
pci=nocrs

# Prevents PCIe from entering deep power saving modes
# known to be buggy on the motherboard (1) firmware.
# Potentially workarounds another bug for suspend
# and/or hibernation.
